# Chatbot-Using-GenerativeAI
Creating a Chatbot using OpenAI, LangChain, Hugging Face.  
I have done this project by attending GenerativeAI MegaWorkshop at Nxtwave ccbp 4.0, 
I got a lot of insights from the host Mr.Rahul Attuluri Sir about GenerativeAI
These are the tools I have learnt from the workshop

GenerativeAI tools:
Google Colab: It is a cloud-based platform by Google designed for running and sharing Jupyter notebooks.
Open AI: An AI-based chat service powered by Open AI's language model.
HuggingFace: An organization known for its popular library providing easy access to pre-trained models and natural language processing tools.
LangChain: A library for building and training language models.
Gradio: An open-source library for building and sharing customizable web interfaces for machine learning models.
PlayHT: PlayHT is a platform that allows you to clone voices using artificial intelligence. The platform uses a deep learning model to train a voice clone that sounds almost exactly like the original voice.
